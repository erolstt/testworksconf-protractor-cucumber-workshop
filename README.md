# how to run

Run the following commands from the root of the project:

1. npm install
2. bower install
3. node server.js
4. gulp serve

Gulp serve should open the browser and point it to **http://localhost:9000**.

In order to run the end-to-end tests make sure that your server and front-end are running using command 3 and 4 from the list above. 
When your application is running properly simply run **gulp e2e** to start the end-to-end tests.
